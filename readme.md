    2015: ES6 introduced


<================= JS start ============================>

printing statements: 
                    |-document.write("This text will show at viewport directly");

                    |-alert("alert at viewport");

                    |-console.log("will show at the console"); // mostly used

uses to statement printing methods: to print:- Data, error, statement


As professionals: [alert()] used for variables.

don't use- document.write('direct to the screen');


<=====   Variable declaration ======>

        |-var = Used in older version before ES6 [we can redeclare✅  and assign ✅]

        |-let = used in new version in ES6 [reassign ✅ and redeclare❌] 

        |-const = used in new version in ES6 [reassign❌  and redeclare❌] 

Variable naming rules:-
    |- Can not start with number 
    |- Can not use space
    |- can not use spacial character except($ , _ )
    |- can not use same name for two or more variables

We should use cammel case notation to write variable or function name.


<==//  Data types //==>

    The Data stored inside the variable will belongs to the perticular type is known as datatype.

Types of Data type:

    |---(i) Primitive data type: 
                                |- String
                                |- Number
                                |- Null
                                |- Boolean
                                
    |---(ii) Non - Primitive data type: 
                                |- Objects
                                |- Array
                                |- function



🔯✅✅ To findout data type of any value or variable, we have a  method [typeof()] 🔯✅✅ 


Objects: We can use multiple types as data inside the object 
        |- Data stores in [key, value] pairs


Array: stores multi kind of data in linear memory location with indexing

array indexing starts from  0 

            arr = [2,3,4,"hello", "sam"]
                   | | |   |        |
                   0 1 2   3        4 --------- indexing
