java script

1: internal java script 
2: External js


History of java script:
                    |- Developed in 1995 by Breadan Eich in just 10 days.

Initially developed to enhance interactivity in website.
It was developed to add dynamic features to static page primarilly for client side development.

JS names: Mocha
          Live script

December 1995 : Live script named as java script

    1995: Java script

    1999: ECMA script 3

    2005: AJAX popularity

    2000: Node.js Launched (by Ryan Dahl)

    2010: React angular view etc frameworks boom

    2015: ES6 introduced


<================= JS start ============================>

printing statements: 
                    |-document.write("This text will show at viewport directly");

                    |-alert("alert at viewport");

                    |-console.log("will show at the console"); // mostly used

uses to statement printing methods: to print:- Data, error, statement


As professionals: [alert()] used for variables.

don't use- document.write('direct to the screen');


<=====   Variable declaration ======>

        |-var = Used in older version before ES6 [we can redeclare✅  and assign ✅]

        |-let = used in new version in ES6 [reassign ✅ and redeclare❌] 

        |-const = used in new version in ES6 [reassign❌  and redeclare❌] 

Variable naming rules:-
    |- Can not start with number 
    |- Can not use space
    |- can not use spacial character except($ , _ )
    |- can not use same name for two or more variables

We should use cammel case notation to write variable or function name.


<==//  Data types //==>

    The Data stored inside the variable will belongs to the perticular type is known as datatype.

Types of Data type:

    |---(i) Primitive data type: 
                                |- String
                                |- Number
                                |- Null
                                |- Boolean
                                
    |---(ii) Non - Primitive data type: 
                                |- Objects
                                |- Array
                                |- function



🔯✅✅ To findout data type of any value or variable, we have a  method [typeof()] 🔯✅✅ 


Objects: We can use multiple types as data inside the object 
        |- Data stores in [key, value] pairs


Array: stores multi kind of data in linear memory location with indexing

array indexing starts from  0 

            arr = [2,3,4,"hello", "sam"]
                   | | |   |        |
                   0 1 2   3        4 --------- indexing 


<=====//  operators //=====>

Operators :  these are the signs that are used to perform the oprations on the operands .

       operands: on which the operation is performed :

       1. Arithmetic Operators :-simple mathematic sign :
          - + / * % ++ --

       2. Assignemnt Operators :
            a. Simple Assignment  Operators :(=) this is used to assign the value
            b.  compound Assignment operator: this is made of combining arithemetic and simple operators ;  += , -+ , /= , *=

        3. Comparison operators : final ans. will be true and false
            a. loos equality : (==): having same value
            b. strict equality :(===): having same value and data types
            c. loos inequality : (!=): not same value
            d. strict inequality:(!==):not same data types or value
            e.  grater than equal to : (>=) :
            f. less than equal to :(<=):
            g. grater than:(>)
            h. less than :(<)

        4. Logical Operators :
            a.  AND :(&&): both condition must be true 
            b. OR : (||): atleast one condition must be true :
            c. NOT :(!):inversion :
