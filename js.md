JavaScript (JS) is a programming language used to make websites interactive and dynamic.

With JavaScript, we can:

Respond to user actions (clicks, inputs)

Change content without reloading the page

Validate forms

Build full applications (frontend + backend)

Originally, JavaScript was created to run inside the browser, but today it also runs on servers, desktops, and mobile apps.

A Short History of JavaScript

1995 – JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in just 10 days

It was developed for the Netscape Navigator browser

Initially named Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript

The name “JavaScript” was chosen for marketing reasons (it is not Java)

As JavaScript grew popular, different browsers started implementing it differently, which caused compatibility issues.

What is ECMAScript (ECMA)?

To solve browser differences, JavaScript needed a standard.

So in 1997, JavaScript was standardized as ECMAScript (ES) by ECMA International.

JavaScript → the language we write

ECMAScript → the official standard/specification for JavaScript

Browsers follow ECMAScript rules to implement JavaScript correctly.
