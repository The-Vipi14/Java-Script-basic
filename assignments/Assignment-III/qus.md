JavaScript Timing Function Practice Questions

#-----Beginner Level
            • Write a program to print “Hello JavaScript” after 3 seconds using setTimeout().
            • Create a program that displays “Time’s up!” after 5 seconds.
            • Print numbers from 1 to 5, each after 1 second using setTimeout().
            • Display a message “Loading...” every 2 seconds using setInterval().
            • Stop a setInterval() after it runs 5 times.
            • Use setTimeout() to print “Welcome to JS” after 2 seconds.
            • Create a program that logs “Processing...” every 3 seconds continuously.
            • Display the current time every second using setInterval().
            • Use clearTimeout() to cancel a scheduled message before it runs.
            • Create a countdown from 5 to 0 using setInterval().

#-----Intermediate Level
            • Make a counter that increases every second and stops at 10.
            • Print “Fetching data…” every 2 seconds, then stop after 4 times.
            • Display “Happy Coding” after 10 seconds using setTimeout().
            • Create a digital clock that prints the current time every second.
            • Build a countdown timer that shows numbers 10 to 0 and then prints “Time’s Up!”.
            • Make blinking text (show/hide every 1 second using setInterval()).
            • Use setTimeout() inside a loop to print numbers 1–5 with 1 second delay each.
            • Create a function that prints the current date every 5 seconds.
            • Start a timer when a variable becomes true, and stop it after 5 seconds.
            • Use both setTimeout() and setInterval() together — print “Start” once, then print “Running” every 2 seconds.
